This is the repository that I store data project related to music!

## 1. Visualizing the spotify music streaming history 
In this very first project, I scrap the song features of my streaming history and my self-created playlists by connecting to Spotify APIs.

The reason that I explore both playlist tracks and streaming history is because streaming is all the song I have listened, some of them may only be played for once since I don't really like it, while I tend to collect the songs I love in my playlists. Those two resources tells a more thorough story about my music streaming preferences.
